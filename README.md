# PyAntidote (A simple Python AntiVirus)

## Status: Partially Abandoned
Reasons:
* md5 isn't reliable enough (too many false positives, I know md5 wasn't ideal, but didn't realize how bad of a choice this was)
* I made this mostly for fun
* I may come back in a few years and write something more suitable to fit the repo's name, for now I'm leaving my failure here for others to learn from
* I may also continue this as a pet project for funsies (not sure yet)

#### This is basically made simply for fun and educational purposes
#### DO NOT TRY TO USE THIS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR A REAL ANTIVIRUS
